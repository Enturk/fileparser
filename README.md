# fileparser

Takes a folder (and any subfolders) of text files and counts the occurrences of a substring defined by limiters in the files' lines.

## Requirements

An input folder, by default named *PastChats*, and an output folder, by default named *TestOutput*. Uses Python 3.7. OS neutral, in theory.
